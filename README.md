# Turn-Based-Style-Game
To get to the title scene to start the game locate the Scenes folder within the Assets folder and within the Scenes Folder, locate the scene called Title Scene
Assets -----> Scenes -------> TitleScene

Also for the Credits Scene, if you dont see anything give it a second, its a rolling credits scene so just wait a second for text to scroll from bottom to top

To stay within the 70/30 rule, 
The only assets which are not mine/created by me are the terrain assets and the models used as playable and enemy characters.
